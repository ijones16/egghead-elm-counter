# Egghead.io : Elm Counter

This little project demonstrates the basic Elm Application Architecture by building a counter.

The `master` branch is all ready for you to start coding. Just run `npm start`, and a browser window should be opened for you. In that browser window click on `Main.elm`, and then use your favorite text editor to begin developing!

Just like any good cooking show, we've also included the end result for your referencing pleasure. Checkout the `finish` branch to get going.

Happy Elming!
